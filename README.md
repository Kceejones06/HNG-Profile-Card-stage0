*.) HNG Profile Card â€” Stage 0: Testable Profile Card

This project is my submission for **HNG Profile Card Stage 0**, where I built an accessible, responsive, and testable **Profile Card** component using **semantic HTML, modern CSS (Flexbox), and vanilla JavaScript**.

---

##  Project Overview

The profile card displays a userâ€™s:
- Name  
- Avatar (uploadable image)  
- Short biography  
- Current time in milliseconds (auto-updating)  
- Social media handles (as clickable buttons)  
- Hobbies and dislikes lists  

Each required element includes the correct `data-testid` attribute for automated testing.

##  Tech Stack
- **HTML5** (semantic structure & accessibility)
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, responsive layout)
- **JavaScript (ES6)** (dynamic time + interactivity)
